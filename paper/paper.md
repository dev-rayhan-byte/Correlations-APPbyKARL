# Summary

Correlation analysis is a cornerstone of empirical research, enabling scientists to identify relationships between variables. However, researchers often rely on a fragmented workflow: statistical software for computation, separate libraries for visualization, and external tools for preparing publication-ready figures. This approach introduces inefficiencies and reproducibility challenges.  

The **KARL Lab Correlation Tool (Pro Edition)** is an open-source, web-based platform designed to unify this workflow. Built with **Python** and **Streamlit**, it provides a no-code interface to compute Pearson, Spearman, and Kendall correlations, visualize results interactively, and export publication-ready figures.  

Key features include:  
- **Interactive and static visualizations**: correlation heatmaps, scatter plots, and pair plots.  
- **Smart Insights module**: automatically highlights the strongest positive and negative correlations.  
- **Publication-grade export**: high-DPI (300â€“600+), multiple formats (PNG, JPG, TIFF), and customizable fonts.  
- **Accessibility**: runs in a web browser with a responsive, mobile-friendly UI.  

By integrating computation, visualization, and export into a single workflow, the tool reduces technical barriers and empowers both novice and expert users to conduct reproducible correlation analysis with ease.

# Statement of need

Researchers across disciplines such as physics, biology, economics, and social sciences rely on correlation analysis as a first step for hypothesis generation, feature selection, and model building. Existing tools present trade-offs:  

- **Programming libraries** (e.g., pandas, seaborn) are powerful but require coding expertise.  
- **Spreadsheet software** (e.g., Excel) offers accessibility but lacks depth and publication-quality outputs.  
- **Commercial platforms** (e.g., SPSS, Tableau) provide advanced features but are costly and closed-source.  

The KARL Lab Correlation Tool bridges this gap by providing a **free, open-source, no-code solution** that integrates statistical rigor with customizable, paper-ready visualizations. This makes it especially valuable in **low-resource research environments** and **educational settings**, where accessibility and reproducibility are critical.
